Originally created for Computer Network Class CSC645 at SFSU \

### Purpose
Users can send messages to each other by sending them to a server.

### Functionality
Users can run the client program and connect to a running server where the user has the options to create an account and log in. Once logged in, the user can get the list of all other users on the network, send a message to another registered account, see their messages, and log out.
