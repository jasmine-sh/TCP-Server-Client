# Socket Programming Project
Originally created for Computer Network Class CSC645 at San Francisco State University

## Purpose
The learning objective of this assignment was to understand TCP connections, sockets, client/server interaction, and the function of the welcome socket.
The purpose of the program is for users to send and recieve messages by connecting to a server where the messages and accounts are stored.

## Instructions
After building, run the server program first (***TextServer*** or ***TCPServer***) to initiate the server side. Then run the client program (***TextClient*** or ***TCPClient***) to act as a user on the server. You can change users by logging out and reconnecting as a different user.

## Functionality
### Required Functionality
Users can run the client program and connect to a running server where the user has the options to create an account and log in. Once logged in, the user can get the list of all other users on the network, send a message to another registered account, see their messages, and log out.

### Additional Functionality
Although not required for the original assignment, the ability for a user to create an account is necessary for the functionality of the messaging program.
